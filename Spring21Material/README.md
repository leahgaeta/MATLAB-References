## ENG EK 125 for Spring 2021  
This repository provides discussion notes and resources for students in BU's ENG EK 125 course that I'm a graduate student teacher for. These are for the MATLAB portion of the course.

- [Notes from 2021-02-19](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Discussion%204.pdf)
- [Notes from 2021-02-26](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Discussion%205.pdf)
- [Notes from 2021-03-05](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Discussion%206.pdf)
- [Notes from 2021-03-12](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Discussion%207.pdf) - note that I made an error in the dates! The extra Open Hours and Study Session will be on 3/17, BU Wellness Day will be 3/18, and the second Exam will be 3/19. The times listed are correct though.
- [Notes from 2021-03-19](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Discussion%208.pdf) - exam 2 review... good luck!

**Extra Notes:**
- [Subplot Example](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Subplot%20Example.pdf) - a subplot example in the form of a function
- [Text Manipulation Stuff to Know!](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Text%20Manipulation%20Stuff%20to%20Know.pdf) - need to know these for the second MATLAB exam... recommend practicing with them in the command window while studying
- [Polyval & Polyfit](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Spring21Material/Polyval%20%26%20Polyfit.pdf) - gotta know polyval() and polyfit() and how to use them, make a trend line, and why they are important!

**Requested Example Scripts**

Requested scripts will be seen here as the semester progresses.
- [Intro_array_operations](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/Intro_array_operations.m) - an introduction to array operations in MATLAB
- [plotting_examples.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/plotting_examples.m) - examples of simple plots, superimposed plots, and subplots
- [myfunction.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/Spring21Material/myfunction.m) - a simple function that can take in a scalar, vector, or matrix
- [myscript.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/Spring21Material/myscript.m) - a simple script that calls the function myfunction()... make sure these are in the same path if using for practice!
- [print_sum_vec.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/print_sum_vec.m) - example function that uses a persistent variable
- [prog_with_stubs.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/prog_with_stubs.m) - example program that utilizes function stubs
- [draw_rectangle.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/draw_rectangle.m) - a program that draws a rectangle using while and nested for loops
- [ex_mod_prog_baseball.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/ex_mod_prog_baseball.m) - example of a modular program that uses a local function and a switch statement
- [pitch_n_switch.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/pitch_n_switch.m) - a baseball program that incorporates user input, while loops, switch statements, and a simple selection statement
- [sandlot.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/sandlot.m) - inspired by The Sandlot, a program that builds a roster using a vector of structs, nested structs, file i/o
- [LADodgers.m](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/blob/master/Spring21Material/LADodgers.m) - example of using text manipulation while reading from a file to print in a specified format
