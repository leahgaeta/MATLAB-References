## MATLAB References

This repository includes example MATLAB scripts and notes for students in BU's ENG EK 125 course that I'm a graduate teaching assistant for. These focus on vectors & matrices, selection statements, loops, text manipulation, basic functions, advanced functions, data structures, and an intro to data science & ML/AI.

**The MATLAB scripts in this repo cover the following topics:**

- [Intro_array_operations.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/master/Intro_array_operations.m) - introduction to vector and matrix operations
- [plotting_examples.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/master/plotting_examples.m) - introduction to plotting in MATLAB (includes simple plots and subplot examples)
- [pitch_n_switch.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/master/pitch_n_switch.m) - example of a switch statement to classify different baseball pitches
- [draw_rectangle.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/master/draw_rectangle.m) - example of while and nested for loops to draw a rectangle
- [func_deriv_4xfourth.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/master/func_deriv_4xfourth.m) - advanced function example with variable number of output arguments
- [sandlot.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/master/sandlot.m) - example script of creating a struct (batting order) and then writing the roster to a text file

**The PDF notes in this repo:**

- [Introduction to MATLAB Notes](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Introduction%20to%20MATLAB%20Notes.pdf): covers ascii, vector/matrix operations, helpful for EK 125's first exam
- [Extra (Advanced) MATLAB Notes](https://github.com/leahgaeta/MATLAB-References/raw/master/Extra%20(Advanced)%20MATLAB%20Notes.pdf): covers statistics, anonymous functions, text manipulation, helpful for EK 125's second exam
